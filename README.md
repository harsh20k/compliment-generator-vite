# 🎉 Compliment Generator

A small project built during my first days at **Dalhousie University** while classes were delayed due to the faculty strike.

It’s a reminder that even in uncertain times, there’s always space to **learn, build, and share**.

This app is intentionally simple but demonstrates a **full-stack deployment** using modern tools:

- ⚛️ **Frontend**: React + Vite
- 🔗 **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Function (`/api/compliment`)
- 🚀 **Hosting**: Vercel (single URL for frontend + backend)

---

## ✨ Features

- Click a button → get a random compliment
- Minimal dark-themed UI
- Serverless backend (no separate infra needed)
- Deployed with **zero-config** on Vercel

## 📚 Lessons Learned

• How to deploy a React + Vite frontend with a serverless backend on Vercel.
• How small projects can be used to stay consistent and accountable while learning.
• Importance of focusing on what you can control in times of uncertainty.

## 📌 Next Steps

• Deploy more “laughably simple” apps to keep learning momentum going

## 🤝 Connect

This project is part of my journey as a Master of Applied Computer Science (MACS) student at Dalhousie University.

I’m building in public to stay accountable and connect with others.
